          <p>My name is Destiny Brito and I'm a super senior here at EWU studying PR/Journalism and Music. Although Eastern has a glorious music program, I plan on transferring my music degree to Cornish in Seattle. In my spare time when I'm not tickling
            the ivories I like to ride bikes with my pals and occasionally putting in some hours of work time at a competitive cheer facility in Spokane. I like to hit up indie rock shows on the weekends and go hiking and skiing when the season comes
            around.

    <p>Sing for hope is a great program that supports young artists who give back to their community! I spent some time in New York this
      <br>summer and got to experience this amazing event. I think it's important for people to get involved and spread some uplifting art contributions
      <br>and get a better understanding of the art community.</p>
